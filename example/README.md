# Example

If you don't have meteor, please install it first.

`curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh`

Then,
* `npm install`

(To install the deps, only needed once)

* `meteor`

And go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Take a look at [client/main.js][]. All the needed code is there.

This example uses a react-only approach to show how to use simple-react-form without meteor, but the same applies if you're
using Meteor.
